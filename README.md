# Astralyne
Hello! Thank you for taking the time to read this readme.
This is a website I am creating to house all of my ideas for my fictional world of Astralyne.

## What is Astralyne
Astralyne is a passion project I've been thinking about for the past few years. I've always enjoyed the idea of world building and ttrpgs.
After becoming a DM for my first dnd game, the idea to do so was strong, and so I began. I initially used diffrent sites such as WorldAnvil and
Google Docs to get my ideas around, but I then realized it was a bit difficult for me to share it in a way that was convenient for my players.

Eventually, I began learning how to code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I had learned a bit of it in High School, but after taking a
Web Dev course in University, it gave me the push to begin trying to make a website for it. And so here we are!

This is mainly meant to be for friends, but if you stumble across this then, hello o/
